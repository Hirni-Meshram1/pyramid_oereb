Standard
========

The standard package is the part where all the database configuration is stored. It also provides really
useful functions to integrate data, as well as creation of a YAML-configuration fitting this standard
structure. In addition you will find here the hook methods which are used in several places in the
configuration and an example usage of the pyconizer package to provide legend entry icons for a dedicated
layer.
